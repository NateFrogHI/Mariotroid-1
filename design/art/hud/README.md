*  the bar at the top is health and should be filled with health.png (x10) when player is at full health

*  the heart is a placeholder for where lives should go (number of lives left goes next to heart)

*  shell.png is the ammo for the alternate attack for the blaster.  The amount of shells on the screen should represent how many shots the player still has.  They should show up next to the heart and the number of lives the player has left.
