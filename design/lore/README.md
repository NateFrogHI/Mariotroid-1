## Lore

**I drew some inspiration from Serenity (Firefly), Alien, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children**

In the year 2105 on a distant planet in the Alpha Centauri system, a hero wakes to the sound of mass destruction and chaos.  Unsure of what is happening he gets out of bed in a panic.  He tries to open the hatch to his sleeping quarters but is trapped.  The lights flicker as the tremmors continue.  

* The user reads text explaining the controls

The hero must find a way to open the hatch to his quarters. *The user finds a crowbar* The hero uses the crowbar to open the hatch to escape and see what is going on.  The bright light of outside pierces the darkness of his hatch.  Our hero's eyes finally adjust to the brightness to find desolation.  His colony, his friends, and his livelihood have all been destroyed.

Armed with only a crowbar, our hero sets off for some answers.  Our hero has his first encounter with a enemy under the control of the calamity (this enemy never actually attacks the hero but moves around).  Throughout his journey, he finds armor and weapons from dead security contractors and vanquished enemies.

* During the encounter our user is instructed on basic combat
* After the encounter our user is instructed on basic inventory manipulation

Towards the middle of the journey, our hero encounters a phantom.  This phantom enters our hero's conscious and attempts to show our hero the pain his colony has brought to this planet but is perceived as an attack (first mini-boss).  After the encounter with the phantom, our hero recaps the experience he had when the phantom invaded his conscious.  All our hero knows at this point is that he needs to escape and try to get back to Earth.

He finds a map of the colony and begins his journey to the shuttle hangars in the hopes that there is still a ship that can get him home.  He fights many monsters and solves many puzzles on his way.

He reaches the shuttle bay to find two shuttles intact.  The hero begins the fueling procedure for the first shuttle.  The ground shakes and the lights flicker.  The power goes out.  A blue glow eminates from a newly formed crack in the ground.  The calamity emerges from the ground and destroys the first shuttle.

Our hero fights an unwinnable battle with the calamity while trying to fuel the second shuttle.  After stunning the calamity, he narrowly escapes the planet in his shuttle only to find out that the cryogenics system of this shuttle is inoperable.

The final cutscene is our hero floating through space on his way to Earth.  We fade out except for the bridge of the ship which shows: "ETA: 94 years, 4 hours, 12 minutes".  Our hero will live out his last days alone in the shuttle.

Outro:
"We should've never have gone to that planet.  Don't go back.

After the calamity flattened the colony, I became a nomad.  Trying to escape, I traveled through what used to be a thriving colony; now slowly being taken back by the planet. 

Outside there is an endless nothing.  The smell and taste of recycled air has driven me insane.  My thoughts have consumed my reality.  I can't tell where my insanity differs from my reality.  My friends are monsters, my enemies are my own thoughts.  I am the only surviving colonist of Proxima B."
