From Wikipedia:
    The sections of a user manual often include:
        A cover page
        A title page and copyright page
        A preface, containing details of related documents and information on how to navigate the user guide
        A contents page
        A guide on how to use at least the main function of the system
        A troubleshooting section detailing possible errors or problems that may occur, along with how to fix them
        A FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
        Where to find further help, and contact details
        A glossary and, for larger documents, an index

        
I think we can skip the copyright, preface, FAQ (maybe), further help, and glossary.
